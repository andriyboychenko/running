I'm a software engineer and spending a lot of time siting in front of computer. So I found that doing some exercise few minutes a day would be beneficial for my health.
I'm not very sporty, so I started this easy program recommended by Swiss Athletics. I'm running at lunch time for max 30 minutes, so like this also avoiding heavy food 🍔🍔🍔. 
Honestly I feel some progress without huge effort. It also makes me more productive in the office... better then coffee ☕ 
While running I can think on some software bug 😀 or just enjoy nature or city landscape.

❗ It's important to consult a sports doctor before starting, especially if you're over 40, and avoid running when sick or injured.
